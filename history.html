									This project was conceived in 2017 summer, when Adam and Rachel, the initial LPA leads read Toronto’s Poverty Reduction Strategy report and were considering what projects this portfolio could tackle. We were interested specifically in challenges that youth experiencing homelessness face. After conducting background research during the summer and fall of 2017 which included discussions with the City of Toronto, experts from the Homeless Hub, and experts who worked on the ground with youth, we noted the challenge of transit access for young people.  
									
									From there, in fall 2017, we recruited a team with the goal of establishing the groundwork to develop a project with the vision of providing any youth requiring free transit this service with as few strings attached as possible. The explicit desire of ‘as few strings attached as possible’ was in response to the recognition that not all youth wish to be classified as ‘homeless’ or even consider themselves to be ‘homeless’ and that being asked to ‘prove’ homelessness is stigmatizing.
									
									In the spring of 2018, our team entered into the Map the System contest and presented our work to a panel of experts at the University of Toronto as one of seven teams at the University of Toronto to who could be selected to move onto the Canada-wide finalists.
									
									From fall of 2018, we recruited a new team of inquisitive, motivated, and talented students and started seriously developing a framework to launch a research project to provide qualitative and quantitative evidence for the impact of transit access for youth people experiencing homelessness. 
									
									At present, our next steps include conducting the study, analyzing the data, then operationalizing the findings.

									Nicola Lawford,
									Adam El-Masri,
									Rachel Wong,
